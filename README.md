My personal experience going into CyberSec

After moving to Tennessee in 2021, I have been in automotive and real estate for over a decade now and wanted to start thinking of a change. We went over the list of things I enjoy working on and being around, one of the ones that I have always been a dream was to work in the IT Field. Looking into the broad IT field, I narrow down some type of cybersecurity would be an awesome thing.
In April 2023, I started to work for a company named Techsmart, LLC. Working here, I was able to get hands on experience in soft and hard skills. My soft skills, I was able to build my skill of communication and problem solving better by the diverse problems I ran into. The hard skills I learned were from finding there is a problem and figuring out how to solve for the problem. *** need to add more****
