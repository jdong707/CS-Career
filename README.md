My personal experience going into CyberSec

After moving to Tennessee in 2021, I have been in automotive and real estate for over a decade now and wanted to start thinking of a change. We went over the list of things I enjoy working on and being around, one of the ones that I have always been a dream was to work in the IT Field. Looking into the broad IT field, I narrow down some type of cybersecurity would be an awesome thing.
In April 2023, I started to work for a company named Techsmart, LLC. Working here, I was able to get strengthen my experience in soft and hard skills. My soft skills, I was able to build my skill of communication and problem solving better by the diverse problems I ran into. The hard skills I learned were from finding there is a problem and figuring out how to solve for the problem. ## need to add more  ##

Which field do I want to do?
After watching plentiful of youtube videos and doing my research, I have found that a career as a SOC Analyst or working in and around the blue team would be great. What intrigues me with the blue team is that they are the defenders when it comes to intel and/or data. I am a graduate of Napa Valley Police Academy in 2012, I have always wanted to protect and help people. Combining both of my passions to join a blue team would be awesome! I know the field is hard to get into, but I will keep on working hard at it. 

What are you doing to study for and what is the path you are taking?
I started my journey towards the end of 2023 to work towards becoming a blue team member in cybersecurity. I have a great knowledge base IMO by being a strong hobbiest since 2008 when I built my first computer. THe want to learn about technology has allowed me to setup at home labs using VMs, use enterprise grade equipment like Inifi Ubiquiti firewalls, AP, Routers, switches and more. Also being a gamer, I have learned port forwarding, TCP/UDP policies to allow internet access into my network as needed and to make sure other ports that are not being used are closed and secure. Over the years, I have learned how to use Iperf3, nmap and more for diagnostic procedures. The OS I have used are Windows 7/10 pro and Linux Ubuntu. 
  Now towards the end of 2023, I started studying for my first certificate, the CompTIA Security+. I chose that certified by doing research, and what I did not understand at the time of studying, it would allow me to study those areas that I was not well informed of. In 2024, I scheduled my Security+ test and passed on February 13! Now that I have accomplished that, I am hoping to land a great job. In the mean time, I will keep learning and getting hands on experience with my lab at home. 

  My goals I am working on as of February are, hand on SIEM experience to review data files, getting better with using bash in linux, and learning python.

  What I have found on this journey, I am very intrigued by Red Team stuff, specifically ethical hacking. I understand in order to be a great Pentester, I will have to be a great defender, so that is my goal is to be the best defender I can be, and to be a Pentester as a hobbiest to keep growing my skill.
